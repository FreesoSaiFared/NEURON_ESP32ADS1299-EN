## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a portable, low-cost system for acquiring EEG signals, using the ESP32 microcontroller and Texas Instruments' ADS1299 analog-to-digital converter. This system enables real-time brain signal capture and processing, facilitating analysis for a range of applications in neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces.

## Features

- **EEG Signal Acquisition**: Captures multiple high-precision EEG signal channels.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes adaptive filters for signal processing.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Transmits data via Wi-Fi using the ESP32.
- **Portability**: Compact design with efficient power consumption.

## Technical Specifications

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32
- **ADC Converter**: 24-bit ADS1299
- **EEG Channels**: Up to 8 channels
- **Sampling Frequency**: Configurable up to 16 kHz
- **Communication**: SPI between ESP32 and ADS1299; Wi-Fi for data transmission
